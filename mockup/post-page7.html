        <p class="post-text">"Sore eyes ni dotty" is a non-specific term that is often used colloquially to describe a variety of eye discomforts or eye-related symptoms. It's important to note that "sore eyes" can refer to a range of issues, and the underlying cause may vary. Here are a few common eye conditions or symptoms that people may refer to as "sore eyes," along with some general considerations:

            Conjunctivitis (Pink Eye): Conjunctivitis is one of the most common causes of redness, irritation, and discomfort in the eyes. It can be caused by viral, bacterial, or allergic factors. Symptoms may include redness, itching, tearing, and a gritty feeling in the eyes. Treatment depends on the cause and may involve antibiotics, antiviral medications, or antihistamines.
            
            Eye Strain: Prolonged use of digital devices, reading in poor lighting conditions, or spending long hours focusing on screens can lead to eye strain. Symptoms may include dryness, irritation, fatigue, and blurred vision. Taking regular breaks, adjusting screen settings, and using artificial tears can help alleviate symptoms.
            
            Allergies: Eye allergies, often triggered by pollen, dust, or pet dander, can cause itching, redness, and watering of the eyes. Avoiding allergens and using antihistamine eye drops or oral medications can provide relief.
            
            Dry Eye Syndrome: Dry eye occurs when the eyes do not produce enough tears or when tears evaporate too quickly. Symptoms may include dryness, burning, stinging, and a gritty sensation. Artificial tears and lifestyle modifications are often recommended.
            
            Foreign Body Sensation: Sometimes, foreign particles like dust or eyelashes can get into the eye, causing irritation, discomfort, and a sensation of having something in the eye. Flushing the eye with clean water or saline solution may help remove the foreign body.
            
            Corneal Abrasion: A scratched cornea can cause significant eye pain, redness, and sensitivity to light. It requires immediate medical attention to prevent complications.
            
            It's important to note that any persistent or severe eye discomfort or changes in vision should be evaluated by an eye care professional. They can diagnose the underlying cause and recommend appropriate treatment. Additionally, if you experience symptoms like sudden vision changes, severe pain, or eye injuries, seek medical attention promptly.
            
            In summary, "sore eyes" can encompass various eye-related issues, and the appropriate response depends on the specific symptoms and their underlying cause. Consulting with an eye doctor is crucial for proper diagnosis and treatment.</p>
