        <h2 class="sub-heading">Migraine Symptoms</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Migraines are severe headaches that are often accompanied by a range of symptoms, which can vary from person to person. Migraine symptoms typically progress through distinct stages, although not everyone with migraines experiences all of these stages. Here are some common migraine symptoms:

            Prodrome (pre-headache phase):
            
            Changes in mood (irritability, depression, euphoria).
            Increased thirst and urination.
            Food cravings or loss of appetite.
            Fatigue.
            Neck stiffness.
            Yawning excessively.
            Aura (experienced by some but not all migraine sufferers):
            
            Visual disturbances (flashing lights, zigzag lines, blind spots).
            Sensory disturbances (tingling or numbness in the face or extremities).
            Difficulty speaking.
            Confusion.
            Muscle weakness.
            Headache Phase:
            
            Throbbing or pulsating headache, often on one side of the head.
            Intense pain that can last for hours to days.
            Nausea and vomiting.
            Sensitivity to light (photophobia).
            Sensitivity to sound (phonophobia).
            Sensitivity to smells (osmophobia).
            Blurred vision.
            Lightheadedness or fainting (in some cases).
            Postdrome (post-headache phase):
            
            Fatigue and weakness.
            Confusion.
            Mood changes (e.g., feeling "washed out" or elated).
            Scalp tenderness.
            General discomfort.
            It's important to note that not all individuals who experience migraines will have an aura, and the severity and duration of symptoms can vary widely from person to person. Migraines can be highly debilitating, and they often require rest and quiet in a dark, quiet room to help alleviate symptoms.
            
            If you suspect you have migraines or experience severe, recurrent headaches with associated symptoms, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and to discuss treatment options. Effective migraine management may involve lifestyle changes, trigger identification and avoidance, and medications prescribed by a healthcare provider.</p>
